# Work-Day-Planner
This project creates a set of text-areas for the average work-day hours. It allows a user to input their plans for the day and saves them to local storage. The current, past, and future hours are all color coded so the user knows when the event time has passed.

Motivation:
This was created as part of the campbootspot programming bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill

Build status:
This is the final version of the build

Code Style:
This code was made with JQuery, day.js(), HTML, and CSS
